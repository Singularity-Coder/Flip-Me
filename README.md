# Flip-Me
The idea is to flip the profile pic 180 degrees horizontally if the head is tilted/faced in the opposite direction of the name. The concept is that the face should face the name. I will use open CV to track the head position and get a boolean result to see if the head is facing right or left. Based on that result I will flip the bitmap 180 degrees horizontally.
